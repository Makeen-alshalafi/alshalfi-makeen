## Idea 1: "Neon Cyber-Minimalism"

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk meets Swiss Style Minimalism. A fusion of high-tech aesthetics with clean, structured typography.

**Core Principles**:
1. **High Contrast**: Deep black backgrounds with piercing neon accents (green/cyan) to create a developer-centric "terminal" feel but elevated.
2. **Typography-Driven Hierarchy**: Using size and weight rather than boxes or borders to define structure.
3. **Motion as Feedback**: Every interaction provides immediate, smooth visual feedback, mimicking a responsive command-line interface.
4. **Content First**: The design recedes to let the content (projects, skills) shine.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Background**: `oklch(0.15 0 0)` (Deep Void Black) - Represents the depth of code and focus.
- **Text**: `oklch(0.95 0 0)` (Pure White) - For maximum readability.
- **Accent**: `oklch(0.85 0.2 140)` (Neon Cyber Green) - Represents success, execution, and the "go" signal in tech. Used sparingly for CTAs and key highlights.
- **Secondary**: `oklch(0.6 0 0)` (Code Gray) - For metadata and secondary info.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Asymmetric Grid**: Breaking the standard 12-column grid. Content flows in a single continuous stream but with offset alignments to create visual interest.
- **Full-Screen Sections**: Each section (Hero, About, Projects) commands the full viewport initially, encouraging focused consumption.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Monospace Accents**: Using a coding font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) for labels, tags, and metadata to reinforce the "developer" identity.
2. **Glowing Borders/Text**: Subtle glow effects on hover states to mimic screen luminescence.
3. **Slash Separators**: Using `/` as a visual motif (e.g., `Projects / 01`) to nod to file paths and directory structures.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Snap Scrolling**: Sections snap into place to give a sense of precision.
- **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons that slightly pull towards the cursor, adding a tactile feel.

**Animation**:
- **Staggered Reveal**: Text lines reveal one by one (like typing or loading data).
- **Parallax Elements**: Background elements (like abstract code snippets or geometric shapes) move at different speeds.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: `Space Grotesk` or `Syne` - Bold, geometric, modern.
- **Body**: `Inter` or `DM Sans` - Clean, neutral, highly readable.
- **Code/Labels**: `JetBrains Mono` - Technical, authentic.

## Idea 2: "Fluid Glass Morphism"

**Design Movement**: Glassmorphism 2.0. Soft, ethereal, and modern, focusing on depth and translucency.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Depth & Layering**: Using blur and transparency to create a sense of 3D space without heavy shadows.
2. **Soft Gradients**: Backgrounds that shift and breathe, creating a living canvas.
3. **Rounded Organic Shapes**: Moving away from sharp corners to friendly, approachable curves.
4. **Light & Shadow**: Using light sources to define form and hierarchy.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Background**: `oklch(0.98 0.01 240)` (Soft Blue-White) or `oklch(0.1 0.02 260)` (Deep Ocean) for dark mode.
- **Glass Surfaces**: White/Black with low opacity and high backdrop blur.
- **Accent**: `oklch(0.7 0.15 300)` (Electric Purple) to `oklch(0.7 0.15 200)` (Cyan) gradients. Represents creativity and flow.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Floating Cards**: Content lives on "glass" cards that float above the background.
- **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text slightly overlap to create connection and depth.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Frosted Glass Cards**: The primary container for projects and skills.
2. **Orbital Backgrounds**: Blurred, moving orbs of color in the background.
3. **Noise Texture**: Subtle grain overlay to add tactile quality and reduce digital sterility.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Smooth Flow**: Scrolling feels like gliding.
- **Tilt Effects**: Cards tilt slightly on hover to emphasize 3D space.

**Animation**:
- **Float Animation**: Elements gently bob up and down.
- **Blur Transitions**: Content blurs in and out during transitions.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: `Clash Display` - Elegant with unique character.
- **Body**: `Satoshi` - Modern geometric sans.

## Idea 3: "Brutalist Grid System"

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism. Raw, bold, and unapologetic. High contrast and structural visibility.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Visible Structure**: Grid lines are visible, celebrating the underlying architecture of the web.
2. **Raw Typography**: Fonts are large, sometimes uncomfortable, demanding attention.
3. **High Contrast Borders**: Thick black borders define every area.
4. **Function over Form**: Aesthetics are derived from utility.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Background**: `oklch(0.95 0.02 90)` (Paper White) or `oklch(0.9 0.1 60)` (Raw Cardboard).
- **Borders/Text**: `oklch(0 0 0)` (Pure Black).
- **Accent**: `oklch(0.6 0.2 20)` (International Orange) or `oklch(0.8 0.2 250)` (Hyper Blue). Used for hover states and key actions.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Strict Grid**: Content is locked into a visible grid.
- **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for dynamic movement.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Thick Borders**: 2px-4px solid borders on everything.
2. **Hard Shadows**: Solid black shadows with no blur (pop-art style).
3. **System Fonts**: Using default system fonts or raw-looking sans-serifs.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Instant Feedback**: Hover states are binary (on/off), no smooth transitions.
- **Cursor Effects**: Custom large cursor that inverts colors.

**Animation**:
- **Marquee**: Infinite scrolling text bands.
- **Hard Cuts**: Transitions are instant cuts rather than fades.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: `Archivo Black` or `Chakra Petch` - Heavy, industrial.
- **Body**: `Public Sans` or `Roboto Mono`.
